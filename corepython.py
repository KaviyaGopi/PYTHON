1) What is python?
ans) Python is a programming language
2) what is a progra language?
Programming Language is a computer language using which we can write instructions (using computer language we can write some instruction , which will executed by computer)
3) who is the father of python?
ans) Guido Van Rossum: 
official DOB: Release date:20 th Feb 1991

4) What is pre requisite to learn python?
ans) nothing

5) in olden days: c language
	I B.TECH / DEGREE : 1 SEM: C LANG
	PYTHON:

Features of Python:

1) simple to learn, to code
2) general purpose high level progr language
3) multi paradigm
4) interpreted
5) opensource
6) freeware
******7) dynamically typed programming language
8) huge library support
9) extensible
10) embedded
11) platform independent

computer: communication channel
channel: computer language: those languages are classified into 2 types: low level, high level
low level: It is not user friendly or programmer  friendly

eg : 1010111101010
     0011010100010
     1110101011111


high level: programmer friendly (Programmer feeling very comfortable such languages are called as hight level language)

eg : x=10
     y=20
     z=x+y


Python is  General Purpose High level Programming language:


high level lang: user / programmer friendly

Q: Why all high level languages are user friendly?
ans: we use english letters, & mathematicals symbols etc to write the program

Q: bengali  ====> english
in this case : translator: who can translate bengali statement into english statements

if i write the program by using english like alphabets(H.L.L) =====> HOW COMPUTER CAN UNDERSTAND UR PROGRAM
Translator: compilers, interpreters

Translator 1: all at a time: compiler
Translator 2: line by line: interpreter

Italian movie: excellent: watch this movie(telugu)

how many ways are there to watch this movie?
1) italian movie-> totally dubbed -> telugu version - watch it: compiler
2) if it is not dubbed-> atleast if i get subtitles in telugu: watch it: interepreter

examples for H.L.L: C,C++,.NET,JAVA,PYTHON,APEX etc
c,c++ ===> compiled languages
python: interpreted language
java: both compiled & interpreted


in python: compilation is done implicitly and then interpretation is done


most of the H.L.L are developed to design some specific applications only
desktop application/stand alone applications: i have to compulsory install the s/w in ur computer
web applications: any application tht follows client:server model

www.flipkart.com
www.google.com
www.gmail.com
www.amazon.com
games, IOT APPLICATIONS,machine learning applications,robotics applications
data science, network applications,AI applications etc

Which companies are using python?
youtube, facebook, twitter, instagram,github,dropbox ,google,amazon  etc

3) Free ware & open source software (FOSS):

Freeware:
VENDOR FOR JAVA ==> Oracle corporation
until java10 version: free of cost: for commercial purpose
but from java 11: u r supposed to pay: Oracle corporation
vendor for .net ==> Microsoft 
compulsory: u have to pay some amount : 

python: is absolutely for free of cost: 
PSF: PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION: NON PROFITABLE ORGANIZATION

OpenSource: implementation of python program langu: is open to all
chemical equations : pharmaceutical : customize python acc to ur requirement: new flavour of python:pharmapython
bought a house from a builder: buyer is not satisfied : customize the house as per requirement
flavours of python:
1) cpython
2) jpython / jython: to work with java application
3) iron python: .net applications
4) pypy: when compared to the compiled languages, interpreted languages are from performance point of
view they r not upto the mark: to overcome this problem : JIT: JUST IN TIME COMPILER
5) ruby python
6) anaconda python:sometimes i want to handle , analyze very huge amount of data:
throughout the world : flipkart , amazon: billions of people 

windows: o.s:  u cant customize: is not open source
unix: os:  Linux, Redhat, ubuntu, hp linux: flavours: open source

4) Platform independent: once if python program is developed, it will run on any platform: 
like on windows, unix, mac os, other 

5) portable: wihtout making any changes to developed python program happily u can port ur python program
to some othe system with differnt architecture ... ur python program will work for sure

6) Python is all rounder: 
python: procedure oriented features, object oriented features, modular programming features, scripting featres

7) python is interpreted program language
